Ok so basically this is a calculator that I initially wrote in 4 hours when I was sleep deprived

It just tells you where the farlands spawn based off certain values

If you really want to know more then just go to the website I'm not explaining everything in a literal markdown file

My raw notes are here (this is the content that I later put into the website): https://virj280.github.io/farlands/Farlands%20math.txt
(by the way the text file is formatted so poorly that you have to zoom out to view the entire thing
no I'm not going to fix it)

By the way I stole the font from another website I made cause I don't feel like making a new one

Also there's a bunch of screenshots of me going through the farlands to make sure my math actually functions

They're located here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KefZslhIhRSKHm0Z_zd-pvSXy-NedrFD/view?usp=sharing
